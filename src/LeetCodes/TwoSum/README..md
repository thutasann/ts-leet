# TWO SUM

# Question

Given an array of integers, return **indices of the two numbers** such that they add up to a specific target.

> You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice

## Given Example

```bash
Given nums = [2,3,11,15], target = 9

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1]
```

## Problem Statement

- In this case, your expected inputs are two things

  - `nums param` which is `an array of numbers`
  - `target` which is also a `number`

- What this really means is that
  - You are given an array and
  - in that array of numbers, you find two elements that added up to this particular target
